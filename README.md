### Hi there! I'm Danielle ðŸ‘‹

- :tomato: star: Transitioned from Dietitics into Data Analytics and Visualization
- :mortar_board: Completed a Data Analytics + Python bootcamp through Savvy Coders
- :computer: Part-time Teaching Assistant for Savvy Coders
- :mag_right: Self-starter that transitioned from Dietetics into Data Analytics and Visualizations. Dietetics focused heavily on research, collecting and analyzing patient data, and effective collaboration. I would love the opportunity to use those skills, as well as my strengths in attention to detail, problem solving, and creativity within analytics and visualizations.
